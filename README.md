# chat-made-with-openai
This simple chat platform was made with the OpenAI chatbot. Note that this may not even work at all (i had trouble with having it connect from other IPs. It also doesn't send messages at the moment and the AI can't fix it either lol)

Any commits you see from me are from the AI trying to fix its own code

Features:

- Basic XSS protection
